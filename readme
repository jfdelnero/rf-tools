Disclaimer / Legal warning : Radio spectrum and the law

In most / all countries the use of any radio transmitting device is required to be

Other than as used in accordance with a licence (or exemption), the use of radio 
equipment is illegal.

So take care to limit the emitting range and power when testing these softwares !
